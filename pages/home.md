# Futurist, with reservations. Designer, developer, and webmaster for hire. Based in Portland, OR.

I'm infinitely curious about design, engineering, the Internet, and faithâ€”and the way each of these intersect with human stories (often in spectacularly messy ways).

#### My Work

I'm currently doing contract work through [PostPost LLC](/postpost), a small studio focused on design, building websites, and helping clients untagle the complexities of Internet technologies.
