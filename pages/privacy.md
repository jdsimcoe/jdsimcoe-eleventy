First off, let me say that I care deeply about your privacy. The amount of information that is mis-used by corporations (small and large) today is disturbing and unncessary. I believe the Internet should be free, open, and safe for all visitors, for all time. Because of this I've chosen software that is more limited in scope in order to provide for you an experience that respects your privacy.

#### Analytics

Many web analytics packages collect a large swath of information (some personally identifiable, and some not). We have chosen to use a software packaged called [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) that protects your personal privacy. To quote from their website:

> “Fathom collects trends and insights, not personal details about specific website visitors.”

> “Our software collects and stores zero personal information about visitors, making us compliant to all current laws.”

No personal information (IP addresses, cookies, etc.) has been or will be used to identify visitors to this site.

#### Personal Information

The only personally identifiable information that is collected on this site, is through the forms on the [Contact](/contact) and [PostPost](/postpost) pages. The site is SSL encrypted by [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and hosted securely on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify also provides HTTPS-encrypted form endpoints that are used to transmit form data. The data collected by the form is at the sole discretion of visitors and isn’t shared with any third-parties. The sole purpose of the Contact Form is to have meaningful personal interaction (via email) with visitors and prospective clients. Your data will never ever be sold or used for anything else. We promise.

#### Concerns

Should you have any concerns or questions about this site’s policies, please contact us at [webmaster@jdsimcoe.com](mailto:webmaster@jdsimcoe.com).
