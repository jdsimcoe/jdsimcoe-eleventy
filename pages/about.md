![Jonathan Simcoe](/static/img/headshot.jpg "Jonathan Simcoe")

In 2018 I coined a phrase on my Twitter account that has sort of "stuck":

> Futurist, with reservations.

I've never taken the time to properly explain myself. I love new things. I always have. God made me that way. It definitely has it's down sides. I tend to covet anything "shiny" or new, and I think I tend to have a bias towards things that are new, than those that are worn and used.

I'm optimistic about the future. The future of humanity. The future of the Christian Church. The future of my family and children. The future that technology creates and enables.

But I'm also cautious. I have reservations, because there are many dystopian realities that are upon us, or we are already living in. I think growth and progress should have limits. We should be asking deeper questions about the way achieving the future we have always dreamed of is eroding our freedom and ability to be deeply human.

Also, our ability to press into the dark unknown, even under the guise of surveilled realities, makes our plight semi-opted-in to, but also cloyingly human.

There is hope. There is always hope.

#### Down to Earth

On a practical level, I'm a designer, developer, and webmaster by trade. I dabble in writing and photography, but I'm most passionate about connecting design and technologies to brands, companies, and stories. The places where all of these collide and intersect I find particularly fascinating. 

#### Oregon

The State of Oregon (in the Pacific Northwest), has been my home all my life. There is something melancholy and magical about this place I live. It still holds many mysteries to me, but it is deeply familiar. Much like God, and much like my beautiful wife.

#### Beyond

I feel like I should have much more to say about myself practically or occupationally, but I think I'll leave things as they are for now. I care deeply about God, and deeply about people. I care about the world we live in, and how the work I do and the relationships I have help form the world into what it is.

I hope you find the content and my work here interesting.
