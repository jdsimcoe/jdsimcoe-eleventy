Today, I'm starting something new. Incidentally, it also happens to be the release date of Halide's beautiful new app: [Spectre](https://spectre.cam/). I've sat on the sidelines for months, ideas bouncing around in my head, but I've been unable to hit the "Publish" button on almost anything.

Part of running your own design and development business is forming new relationships with clients, and (shocker!) actually doing project work. This has left little to no time for me to create new things. I've realized that the explorative nature of side projects isn't just a luxury. For me, so many of my new ideas and technical discoveries that bleed into client projects are found when I have the freedom to experiment and try new things.

In some ways, it's essential to the work that I do, and the clients I serve.

Also, I've realized that trying to maintain two web presences (one here, and the other for [PostPost](/postpost)) is too much for a solo operation. So I'm simplifying. Stripping things back to basics. This site will be where I share my learnings, write articles, showcase my work, and pursue new client projects.

Trying new things can be daunting. But I'm tired of always playing it safe. Life is too short.

I hope you follow along with me, and please, please, please (!) [reach out](/contact) if you want to talk further or work together. Either way, I'd love to hear from you.

Onward and upward.
